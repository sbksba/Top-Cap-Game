How Can I Contribute?

üêõ Reporting Bugs

A bug is a demonstrable problem caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful. Before submitting a bug report, please check if the issue has already been reported. If not, open a new issue and include the following information:

* A clear and descriptive title.
* Steps to reproduce the bug: A simple, step-by-step list to re-create the problem.
* Expected behavior: What you thought would happen.
* Actual behavior: What actually happened.
* Screenshots or videos (if applicable).
* Your environment details: Operating system, browser, etc.

‚ú® Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are for new features or improvements to existing functionality. To suggest an enhancement, please open an issue and:

* Use a clear and descriptive title.
* Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature.
* Explain the use case for the feature.
* Explain why this feature would be useful to other users.

üìù Making a Pull Request (PR)

Pull requests are the best way to get your changes into the project.

* Fork the repository and clone your fork to your local machine.
* Create a new branch from the main branch : `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
* Make your changes. Be sure to follow the project's coding style and conventions.
* Write a good commit message. A good commit message describes the "why" and "what" of your changes.
* Push your changes to your forked repository : `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
* Open a pull request to the main branch of the original repository. In the pull request description, explain the changes and reference the issue it addresses (e.g., "Closes #[issue number]").

Commit Messages

We use a standard format for all commit messages to ensure a clean and readable history. This helps us generate the changelog automatically and track changes more effectively. Please follow this template:

\[\<type\>\(\<scope\>\)]: \<description\>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

The type is a required keyword that describes the nature of the change.

* feat: A new feature is added.
* fix: A bug is fixed.
* refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
* docs: Changes to documentation.
* perf: A code change that improves performance.
* test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing ones.
* chore: Routine tasks that don't affect the user-facing application (e.g., build scripts, dependencies).

Scope (Optional)

The scope provides more context for the change. Use one of these to specify which part of the codebase you changed:

* frontend
* backend
* ui
* game-logic

Description

A brief, one-sentence summary of the commit. Write it in the imperative mood, as if you are commanding the change (e.g., "Add new feature," not "Added new feature").
